## Current Projects

<p align="justify">
Currently, he is researching seizure prediction models using cardiac data (ECG) to improve early detection of epilepsy through AI, exploring the novel application of ECG data instead of the more commonly used EEG data for this purpose. His Master’s thesis explores causal relationships among key factors affecting customer retention using artificial neural networks, reflecting his broader interest in causal inference and explainable AI.
